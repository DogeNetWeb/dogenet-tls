/* sscert.h — the self-signed ORIGIN server certificate.
 *
 * The other half of the DANE story: ca.c mints what the *browser* sees, this
 * mints what the *origin server* serves — the cert whose SubjectPublicKeyInfo
 * hash the name's owner publishes as `_443._tcp TLSA 3 1 1`. Under DANE-EE
 * (usage 3) no CA signs it and no verifier walks a chain: the chain-published
 * SPKI hash IS the trust anchor, so self-signed + long-lived is exactly right.
 * Until now operators hand-rolled this with the openssl CLI (and LibreSSL vs
 * OpenSSL disagreements produced mismatched pins); this makes it one call.
